# Online Store Task

## Task Overview

### Goal
The goal of this task is to create an multi-page application that mimics an online shop with a limited number of functional elements, demonstrating proficiency in React and Bootstrap.

### Focus Area
- React Functional Components: Building the application using functional components in React.
- Routing: Implementing navigation between different pages of the application.
- State Management: Using useState, useRef, global state and local storage to manage the state of the application.
- Bootstrap Integration: Enhancing the visual appeal by integrating Bootstrap components.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Limitations: Functionalities such as user authentication/authorization, specific functionalities of online stores are out of scope.

### Relevance
React is a powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces, and understanding state management is crucial for creating interactive applications. Using tools like useState, useRef, react global state, and local storage allows developers to manage the application state effectively. Integrating Bootstrap components helps in quickly building responsive and visually appealing interfaces.
